We did too well against div D teams (Collecting Countless Stars) but div C teams are still a challenge as we are a brand new team working on synergy and it seems to be about a 50/50 on how we do against C teams. I think C would be best atleast starting out. We have been doing pretty terribly playing in Storm League so lack practice. I did scrim my Coaches' team (syco's team called ""It's Gonna be ""mei) but we got dominated by them and did not seem close, we have scrimmed Clouded minds recently and did 4 games, we won 1/4. . He seems to beleive both our teams are div B but I dont see how that can be since the highest person we have on the team has only been low D5 in the lifetime of playing, and they have multiple diamond, previous master on their team so I dont think we would do well in div B if that is what we are going against. We have also scrimmed Crit Kickers, and One Punch Monk which we didnt seem to stand a chance against. I really think we are currently a div C team but maybe with a whole season of actual practice against other teams we can become better.
